  text: 'CAquencer hopes to give the audience a new insight into complex cellular
    automaton. It combines playful visuals and audio to lure the viewer in but underneath
    it is a 1D cellular automaton with 1024 possible states per cell and 1,114,942,319,124,480
    possible input states. With the way it breaks up the states and input states it
    is my hope that a viewer might be able to create systems far to complex for them
    to visualize if they were not simplified. '
